## My Journey from Social Worker to Analyst

### About Me
I am a social worker by training. I have an MSW and am licensed. I have worked in the field for 6 years. I listen to enough podcasts to know that I am not yet an analyst, but I enjoy thinking analytically and my goal is to one day be able to call myself a "data analyst".

### About this Repository
The purpose of this repository is to house projects that I am working on to develop various skills that I may need (or just want) on this journey. It is a work in progress.
