### About Me
I am a social worker by training. I enjoy thinking analytically, I love learning new things, and my goal is to one day be able to call myself a "data analyst".

### About this Repository
The purpose of this repository is to house projects that I am working on to develop various skills I may need (or just want) on this journey. It is a work in progress.

### Projects
* [Buffalo Neighborhood Suitability Project](https://broklori.github.io/buffalo-neighborhood-suitability-project)

This project was inspired by an upcoming move to a new city. It is intended to help the user identify which neighborhoods would be most desirable based on characteristics that they deem most important. At this time, the code for the cloropleth can demonstrate a single variable or an index variable (like the sample - overall child opportunity). The source code came from Benjamin Cooley's ["Let's Make a Map!"](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-make-a-map-using-geopandas-pandas-and-matplotlib-to-make-a-chloropleth-map-dddc31c1983d) article on Medium.com, and was adapted to use data from the US Census Bureau (or [datadiversitykids.org](http://www.diversitydatakids.org/)) or really, any dataset that has a GEOID (or census tract) as a column. I used Google Colaboratory for this version of the project, as it allowed for easy sharing/collaboration without the need to download anything except for the shapefiles and a spreadsheet. I intend to post another version that runs in Jupyter notebook.

Note: If you want to try out other variables, I found that the [US Census Bureau Factfinder](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) is a great place to pull data from.
